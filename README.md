Analog Watch

Hosted link:-https://dubey123459.github.io/analog-clock/

This is a simple analog watch built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It displays the current time using hour, minute, and second hands on a traditional analog watch face.

Getting Started

To get started with the analog watch, follow these steps:


1:- Clone the repository or download the source code.

2:- Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.

Alternatively, you can copy the contents of the index.html, style.css, and script.js files into new files on your local development environment.

Usage

Once the analog watch is running, it will automatically display the current time. The hour hand represents the current hour, the minute hand represents the current minute, and the second hand represents the current second.

The watch face also includes hour markers and a digital time display at the center for added convenience.

Customization

You can customize the analog watch by modifying the CSS code in the style.css file. Here are some possible modifications:

Change the color, size, or shape of the hour, minute, and second hands.
Adjust the width, style, or color of the hour markers.
Customize the background color or image of the watch face.
Feel free to experiment and make the watch match your personal style or design preferences.
